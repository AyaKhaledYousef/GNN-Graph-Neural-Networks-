# GNN(Graph Neural Networks)

## Part 1:

  - looking at what kind of data is most naturally phrased as a graph, and some common examples.
  
## Part 2:

  - Exploring what makes graphs different from other types of data, and some of the specialized choices we have to make when using graphs.
  
## Part 3 :

  - Building a modern GNN, walking through each of the parts of the model, starting with historic modeling innovations in the field. 
  
## Part 4:

  - Providing a GNN playground where you can play around with a real-word task and dataset to build a stronger intuition of how each component of a GNN model contributes to the predictions it makes.
